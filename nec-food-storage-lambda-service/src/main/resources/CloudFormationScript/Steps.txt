1. Create Certificates and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
2. Create certificates and signing requests for our devices. 
Example we will provision 1 device which will use individually unique certificates. 
In this example, we’ll be using the openssl command on an AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux to create the certificates. 
The commands below will create the certificate private key file and the CSR file for the device.
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout device_one.key -out device_one.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/L=Seattle/O=MyOrg/CN=MyDept"
